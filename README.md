# Project-Yield-Curve-Model-Calibration
Group project (MSc in Computational Finance): we implemented Nelson-Siegel and Svensson yield curve models using real bond data from Italy, the US, and Japan. Parameters were optimized with Gradient Descent and Newtonâ€™s Method, comparing the models mathematically, computationally, and economically.
